# TTP-FS

For this assessment, you’ll need to implement a web based stock portfolio app. For
the purpose of this exercise a stock is simply an asset that can be bought or sold
(like a house) at a price that continuously rises and falls throughout the day. Up to
date pricing information is available for free via the IEX API. A guide to the UI can be
observed below. Your implementation doesn’t need to be an exact match but should
implement all of the listed user stories. In addition to the user stories, your
submission will be assessed for readability, code organization, commit history
clarity, overall UI/UX, and overall API design.

## Setup

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/Thanh-Lai/TTP-FS.git
npm install
```

## Start

`npm run start-dev` to run server and webpack!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
